// Random readme:

Tested on Windows, Linux, and OSX.

Ionic is a simple library for outputting tables to the console. It can print
in color, line break, align text, and supports several output styles.
Ionic is simple; it doesn't have a lot of features, but it's easy to use, and
runs reasonably efficiently.

Ionic is similar to Tabulate (<https://github.com/p-ranav/tabulate>) but it is
much simpler, both in code and features. Ionic has built-in support for
terminal width, which is a convenience Tabulate does not have.

It has no dependencies beyond C++ 17. Ionic does have platform code - it calls
windows / linux / osx functions to initialize the console and query size.
